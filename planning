Homepage

The pros of it 

Reaction time improvement studies  - info and image
fine motor movement training - statistics
problem solving - info and image
Vocabulary Improvement - Info (opinion) and image

When explaining these points, add Embeds to showcase some proof, should probably use flex to be able to put them on the same alignment

Below is an example of displaying input on a html webpage

<head>
    <title>Input and Return Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Input and Return Example</h1>
    <form id="inputForm">
        <label for="userInput">Enter something:</label>
        <input type="text" id="userInput" required>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <h2>Your Input:</h2>
    <p id="output"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById('inputForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
            event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
            const userInput = document.getElementById('userInput').value;
            document.getElementById('output').textContent = userInput; // Display the input
            document.getElementById('userInput').value = ''; // Clear the input field
        });
    </script>

</body>
</html>

document.getelementbyid is used to declare the entire form tag, adding the event listener and prevent default stops the button from actually doing anything so we can re use it for our purpose.

const user input allows us to take the input value from html and declare it a variable in JS.

The tier list should contain a 
Table is used for this 
5 x ? (undecided because I am not sure how many games I will use)

Tier    Logo & Name     pros (unordered list)   cons (<-)   Steps to install (ordered list)

Add warning to always check where installing, and if other drives are owned to put it in a storage that doesnt have the OS, to improve performance

Contact me should go in the footer, redirects user to a page talking about how to get in touch with me, as well as a bunch of filler about reserved rights.

COLOR PALLETE
backgrounds will be #B2BCAA 
text backgrounds will be #122932
Navigation bars  & footer will be #4C212A (Subject to change)

font is  font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;


Prediction of homepage
I am going to make the entire page one flex box so that I can make a column flex box as a navigation sidebar
and then the item directly to the side of it will be another container.

to make the footer at the bottom, it will be another container on the OUTSIDE of the main container that has the sidebar
this is because flex boxes stack horizontally, so when i place that footer on the bottom it will stack below the main information
